Ballistic Bowling

This is a game which i made with the help of Javascript language. As the word "Ballistics" refers to the science or study of the movement, behavior, and effects of projectilesâ€”like bullets, missiles, or in this case, a bowling ball, this game uses many commands to bring a real life aspect to the game. It is been made by Javascrpit and includes matter.js which enables life like stimulations like gravity, collions, elasctiy which as been demonstared in the game. It uses many such concepts and when the bowling ball gets hit to the pin they fall them just like when a normal thing is dropped with the infulenece of gravity. When space bar is pressed the ball rests and u can continue playing.
